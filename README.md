Overview:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict salaries based on features like education, experience, and location. The goal is to develop a robust prediction model using various algorithms.

Structure:
Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the full pipeline from data processing to model evaluation.

Data: Holds the dataset used for training/testing.

Models: Stores trained models for easy inference.

Scripts: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.

requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies needed to run the project.

README.md: Project overview and setup instructions.

Key Features:

1)Data cleaning and preprocessing.

2)Training multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

3)Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R^2.

4)Feature importance analysis.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook for model training or use pre-trained models for predictions.

Future Work:

Hyperparameter tuning and cloud deployment.
